What Keeps the F-35 Alive By David Swanson on October 31, 2016 Petition to Stop F-35 Going Global \\nby David Swanson \\nImagine if a local business in your town invented a brand new tool that was intended to have an almost magical effect thousands of miles away. However, where the tool was kept and used locally became an area unsafe for children. Children who got near this tool tended to have increased blood pressure and increased stress hormones, lower reading skills, poorer memories, impaired auditory and speech perception, and impaired academic performance. \\nMost of us would find this situation at least a little concerning, unless the new invention was designed to murder lots of people. Then it’d be just fine. \\nNow, imagine if this same new tool ruined neighborhoods because people couldn’t safely live near it. Imagine if the government had to compensate people but kick them out of living near the location of this tool. Again, I think, we might find that troubling if mass murder were not the mission. \\nImagine also that this tool fairly frequently explodes, emitting highly toxic chemicals, particles, and fibers unsafe to breathe into the air for miles around. Normally, that’d be a problem. But if this tool is needed for killing lots of people, we’ll work with its flaws, won’t we? \\nNow, what if this new gadget was expected to cost at least $1,400,000,000,000 over 50 years? And what if that money had to be taken away from numerous other expenses more beneficial for the economy and the world? What if the $1.4 trillion was drained out of the economy causing a loss of jobs and a radical diminuition of resources for education, healthcare, housing, environmental protection, or humanitarian aid? Wouldn’t that be a worry in some cases, I mean in those cases where the ability to kill tons of human beings wasn’t at stake? \\nWhat if this product, even when working perfectly, was a leading destroyer of the earth’s natural environment? \\nWhat if this high-tech toy wasn’t even designed to do what was expected of it and wasn’t even able to do what it was designed for? \\nAmazingly, even those shortcomings do not matter as long as the intention is massive murder and destruction. Then, all is forgiven. \\nThe tool I’m describing is called the F-35. At RootsAction.org you can find a new petition launched by locally-minded people acting globally in places where the F-35 is intended to be based. Also at that link you’ll find explanations of how the tool I’ve been decribing is the F-35. \\nThe petition is directed to the United States Congress and the governments of Australia, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Turkey, the United Kingdom, Israel, Japan and South Korea from the world and from the people of Burlington, Vermont, and Fairbanks, Alaska, where the F-35 is to be based. This effort is being initiated by Vermont Stop the F35 Coalition, Save Our Skies Vermont, Western Maine Matters, Alaska Peace Center, University of Alaska Fairbanks Peace Club, North Star Chapter 146 Veterans For Peace, World Beyond War, RootsAction.org, Code Pink, and Ben Cohen. \\nThe petition reads: \\nThe F-35 is a weapon of offensive war, serving no defensive purpose. It is planned to cost the U.S. $1.4 trillion over 50 years. Because starvation on earth could be ended for $30 billion and the lack of clean drinking water for $11 billion per year, it is first and foremost through the wasting of resources that this airplane will kill. Military spending, contrary to popular misconception, also hurts the U.S. economy ( see here ) and other economies. The F-35 causes negative health impacts and cognitive impairment in children living near its bases. It renders housing near airports unsuitable for residential use. It has a high crash rate and horrible consequences to those living in the area of its crashes. Its emissions are a major environmental polluter. \\nWars are endangering the United States and other participating nations rather than protecting them. Nonviolent tools of law, diplomacy, aid, crisis prevention, and verifiable nuclear disarmament should be substituted for continuing counterproductive wars. Therefore, we, the undersigned, call for the immediate cancellation of the F-35 program as a whole, and the immediate cancellation of plans to base any such dangerous and noisy jets near populated areas. We oppose replacing the F-35 with any other weapon or basing the F-35 in any other locations. We further demand redirection of the money for the F-35 back into taxpayers’ pockets, and into environmental and human needs in the U.S., other F-35 customer nations, and around the world, including to fight climate change, pay off student debt, rebuild crumbling infrastructure, and improve education, healthcare, and housing. \\nAdd your name . \\nDavid Swanson is an author, activist, journalist, and radio host.

              "6956   Obscured American: Eddie the Housepainter                                                    Linh Dinh                            => Eddie and Friends \\nWhen 46-year-old Eddie found out I’d been interviewing people, he wanted to talk. “You can write a book about me!” and that’s true enough, but then again, I’ve never met an uninteresting person. \\nWithin a minute, Eddie was showing me photos of women on his cell phone. There was plenty of skin and at least one crotch shot. These voluptuous ladies had sent these boudoir selfies to him, Eddie growled, his eyes sparkling. \\nEddie’s a beefy dude, with a head like an Olmec statue. Though he wears a permanent scowl, it’s a friendly scowl. \\nEddie was in Friendly Lounge with his housepainting boss, Tony, an Italian dude who used to live in the neighborhood. \\nAfter talking to Eddie, I checked out his FaceBook page. “im a fun loving guy who just wants peace in my life,” he introduces himself, and the first two photos feature Eddie with white women. In one, he’s in some bar and wearing a white T-shirt, “WHITE GIRLS LOVE ME.” With his arms outstretched, Eddie’s surrounded by eight white females and one bald white guy. The women appear to be in their 30’s and 40’s, though one, wearing granny glasses, has sweated, cursed and imbibed her way through nearly six decades, it seems. You go, grandma! In the other photo, two beaming blondes drape themselves all over Eddie. \\nBelow these shots, there’s a video of Oprah Winfrey begging her audience to vote for Hillary Clinton, and down the page, there’s a computer animation of Donald Trump making his most grotesque faces while sitting on a toilet. \\nTalking to me, Eddie brought up the pains of being rejected by his dad all his life. The rates of American children being born out of wedlock have been rising, calamitously, for decades, and currently stand at around 40%. Among blacks, it’s 72%. \\nI’ve known Tony since high school. He lives in the suburbs too. I grew up in West Philly, right around the corner from the zoo, then I moved to the suburbs. I’ve been working with Tony for two years. \\nI was in Boston for ten years. The only reason I came back here was because I had the cancer and everything. After they did the surgery, my family wanted me to come back, you know, be closer to home, in case it happens again. \\nI was doing work. The customers loved the work. Their relatives were from Boston, and they were like, “Do you travel?” I said, “If it’s worth it, yeah.” \\nSo they put me on a job up there, and my ex-girlfriend, I stayed at her house for a while, then I bought my own place. When I moved up there, I just got work, work, work, work. \\nI loved it up there! I loved it! I loved it! I loved it! \\nIt’s funny because I’m not like most black guys, black people, you know. I love the water, being out there on the water, fishing and all types of stuff, and there are so many bodies of water up there. That’s where I get my peace of mind, you know what I mean? I sit there and don’t have a care in the world. I didn’t have my own boat. I was renting the stuff right there. \\nHere, it’s not the same because you can’t get in the water. I love fresh water. Fresh water is beautiful. I like deep sea fishing, salt water and all that, but freshwater is beautiful. \\nThis whole summer, I didn’t hit the water at all. I didn’t even swim this summer. Did you hear what I just said, Tony? This whole summer, I didn’t even swim. Like, what the fuck! \\nThey have lakes up there, and they have park rangers and they’ve got grills up there, where you can grill, volleyball nets, all that stuff. \\nIt’s $4 a car-load, so you can have six people in a car. It only takes $4 to get in there. You can swim, fish, play volleyball, and you can do that almost any time. \\nEverybody kept telling me that it’s crazy to move up there, like they’re so prejudiced up there, but they’re not. They were so nice. \\nThe first day I got up there, people were opening doors for me. They were like, “Hey, how are you doing?!” It was totally different from here, you know, and I loved it, just loved it. \\nIt’s not racial at all. There were so many mixed couples, so many Brazilians, Ecuadorians, all types. Puerto Ricans, Chinese, Asians, all, all, everything. \\nThey did have a bad rap, but it’s just not correct. \\nThey do still have certain areas. They still have these little gangs. Like, one of my buddies wanted to take me to a club. We get there, and I have to park down the street. They had already gone inside the club, but I had to park. When I got close, walking, two dudes stopped me. There was a black guy and a Puerto Rican guy. They were like, “Yo, you got the wrong color on.” \\nSo I opened my mouth, and I said, “You’ve got to be kidding me,” and I was laughing. “You don’t know my lifestyle. You’re coming at me like that?” \\nAs soon as I opened my mouth, though, they were like, “Oh, you’re not from around here. Where are you from?” I said I’m from Philly, so they were like, “You’re cool, man.” I laughed at them, basically. \\nThere are different levels with me. You get mad, you get angry and you get upset, you know what I’m saying? I try not to get angry, at all. Angry takes me to a totally different place, which is not good, so I try not to do that. I try to stay at one focal point and, even though I’m mad at you right now, I’ll still say something stupid so that you laugh. \\nLet’s say you’re just bothering me. I’ll walk outside or something, then come back in, and I’ll start fucking with you back, but in a fun way. Even though you were fucking with me in a bad way, I’ll come back and fuck with you, in a good way. ORDER IT NOW \\nI always try to turn a negative into a positive. \\nYou’re not going to defeat me by your words or whatever, you know, because I’m very smart. In the 7th grade, I used to smoke weed and stuff like that, came to class all high, and I still got A’s on my tests. \\nThey kept me after school, you know, because I was cheating, and I still got the same grade, so they were like, “You’re so smart to be so dumb.” \\nMy sociology teacher said, “You shouldn’t be getting high. You’re too intelligent for that.” It stuck with me all my life. \\nLike, me and him are FaceBook friends. I texted him, “Hey Mr. Coleman, blah, blah, blah. Yo, thank you for saying that to me when I took your class,” and he was like, “Well, Eddie, I don’t remember what I said.” I told him, “You said that I was so smart to be so dumb,” and I always took that into my brain. \\nMy kids are mixed. I love white women. Ha, ha, ha! \\nWe all bleed the same damn color. People don’t realize that racism is taught. If you take an Asian kid, a black kid and a white kid and put them in the sandbox, they’re going to play, until somebody say they can’t play with that child. \\nIt’s the parents. The parents may come up to that kid, “Get out of there! You can’t play with them!” You know what I mean? The kids will act how kids act. They don’t know no better. They’ll play! \\nMe, I have no problems at all. You respect me, I respect you. \\nLike I said, I have mixed kids, but growing up, I was shot at because I was black. I walked through the wrong neighborhood. Somebody tried to shoot me with a harpoon! I’ve been through some shit. I can’t help it if I’m black. I can’t help that. \\nThat’s what he does, you know, scuba diving. He didn’t hit me. I was lucky I got pushed out of the way. This was growing up in the suburbs, Lansdowne, Yeadon, Upper Darby. I got shot at, you know what I mean, because I walked on the sidewalk. \\nCops in Darby, they beat me up. It was a domestic call. My wife was white, OK? We had kids, mixed kids. The argument was next door, not my house, but they came at my house, threw me down the steps, beat me up, put me in a cop car, then turned around and told me, “If you don’t want to go to the hospital, you better give me your address,” so I gave them my address. \\nThey were like, “You don’t live there. A white girl lives there.” They were like, “Where you live at?” I gave them the address again. They were like, “You don’t live there! You go to the hospital,” so guess what? I went to the hospital. They beat me the fuck up! \\nThey took me from my house. She was living there, with me! \\nI couldn’t even fight back. My wife said, “That’s my husband,” but they made her go back in the house. This was ‘92. \\nI came home the next day. They ripped my shirt. I had a button shirt. They cut it in the back, with a razor, so I’m walking in my shirt with a hole in it. They made me walk home without no shoes. \\nSo I went to my old neighborhood. I talked to my mom and all that, and we went to the Lansdowne police station, because we knew an officer there. They said there was nothing they could do about it, because there’s a code of silence among the police officers, or so they said, so my sister took it to a different level. \\nI don’t know if you’ve ever heard of Mary Mason? WHAT? My sister took it to a radio station. They had a picture of me. They had a picture of my clothes. They had a picture of me all beat up and everything. \\nOver nothing! Over nothing! Literally. I was beaten up over nothing! \\nI ended up suing them but, again, I was young, so I settled out of court with them. I ended up getting, like, $45,000. If I kept it going, I would have gotten a whole lot more. \\nLike I said, again, then I was selling drugs. I had an arsenal. I had guns and stuff like that, you know. I was going to blow the police station the fuck up, you know what I mean, but the police station was right next to a school, so I couldn’t do that. \\nNo, I didn’t have a record then. I never got caught. \\nThey were arguing next door. It wasn’t us! They went to the wrong house and fucked me up! \\nI’ve got three friends that are police officers. I trust them, but I don’t trust those other ones. As soon as I saw them, it’s, “Yes, sir,” whatever, but they threw me to the ground and worked me over! \\nFor two years, they harassed me. They banned me from that town. If they saw me driving, they’d pull me over. They were like, “You’ve got two minutes to get out of this town!” \\nI had to move back to my mom for a little while. My wife and kids, too. \\nI never got bitter over that. I get sick of reading stuff now in the news. I think about my children’s security. It pisses me off, you know. \\nLike I said, again, I already lived that life. Innocent people getting beaten up by the cops, getting killed, that could have been me, I could have gotten killed. That night. \\nWhat I was doing was, I was avoiding that act, you know, which was kind of hard to do, because certain roads led that way, so I had to take back streets just to keep away. Again, I was still young too. \\nI was going to blow the hell out of that police station, you know what I mean? I had the artillery to do it, but, again, glory to God and all that. God had my back! Otherwise, that police station and whoever was in it was gone! ORDER IT NOW \\nThere’s a kid that I went to school with, they killed him in a cell. Now, when they put you in that cell, they take your shoe strings, they take your belt and they take your shirt from you, so how are you going to hang yourself? He’s 6-4. How do you hang yourself when you’re 6-4 and you’re in a 6-foot cell? You can’t! \\nHe was a good kid, but he was a bad kid, you know what I mean? I forget how he got locked up. He got locked up for something. They killed him the same night. They locked him up, then they killed him. You can look it up. It’s on the internet still. \\nMy wife stayed with me. Five years later, we split up, but it wasn’t over that. I had three children with her, my oldest three. \\nShe got mad because I moved on. I had another woman. I was just having another kid. I had a reason to dump her, you know what I mean? If you’re in a relationship, and you’re not growing. You’re supposed to grow together. She cheated on me. I’m sure she did. She got caught twice, so when she started doing it, I started doing it. \\nShe did it first, she did it first, she started it. \\nAll I did was work. I worked, then came home, I swear to God! I was bringing home $1,300 cash a week. I was taking out vent systems, heaters, boilers and all that. I was bringing all this money home. It’s heavy work, back-breaking stuff. All you wanted to do was go home to your shower and that’s it. Eat, then sleep. \\nI was mad because she was collecting welfare. It’s like, “Why are you collecting welfare?” We’ve got plenty of money. We had a good life. It’s because of her girlfriends. It was like, “You can get this, you get that.” Now, I had no insurance and stuff. I told her, “You can get the medical, and you can get the food stamps, but don’t get the cash,” but she went out and got it all. She got all the benefits, so I ended up in the system. \\nI told the judge, “How are you locking me up, when my kids live with me? Like, what are you talking about? This is my house. My kids live with me and everything.” Well, it was because of her, she was getting welfare, but I didn’t know. \\nI was getting locked up for a month here, a month there, you know. When they locked you up in the state of Pennsylvania, they suspended your license, so how could you get to work? If you had a driving job, you couldn’t do it. It’s fucked up! \\nI told the judge, again, here you go, “My kids live with me. I don’t owe her nothing. Why am I here? If you look at the record, you’ll understand what I’m talking about here. I’m confused. You guys locked me up, like, six fuckin’ times,” so he said, “Ma’am, why is he here?” \\n“Oh, I’m trying to get more money, blah, blah, blah blah,” so he looked and found out that she had a warrant out, so he said to me, “Mr. Calvin, you want me to lock her up? What she’s doing is welfare fraud.” \\nI said, “Your honor, no.” I said no. “We’re not together no more. I didn’t suffer from you guys. I was in the system. I was in jail six times, but I’m done now.” I said, “No, that’s my kids’ mother. Don’t lock her up.” \\nHe went to her, and he said, “Ma’am, this is a hell of a nice guy. Why did you do this to him?” She had no answer. \\nShe was acting real stupid. I looked at her and I said, “I told you you wasn’t going to get no money.” That’s what I said to her. “I told you you weren’t going to get no money. The judge could have locked you up, no matter what I said. You heard what he said. It was welfare fraud. You’re stupid for even bringing me in here.” \\nI had three kids with her, my oldest three. \\nI have a kid that’s getting ready to turn four, up in Boston. All of my other kids are here. I’ve got 24, 21, 20, 16, 15 and one that’s getting ready to turn four. I grew up without a father, so I was going to make sure I’m not going to be like my father, you know what I mean? \\nMy three oldest, I put money into their accounts, in their names. They each have $50,000 in their bank account, right now. They’ve got more money than I do. Now, my younger ones, my 16 and 15-year-old, they’ve got about $10,000. The baby don’t have shit, you know what I mean, but she’s going to get hers. \\nI was doing the smart thing with the money. Like I said, I grew up without a father, so I’m going to provide for my kids, no matter what. I’ll suffer later, but as long as my kids are OK, then I’m happy. \\nWhen I did get to know my father, I met him in church. I was 16 years old when I got to meet my father. I went to church with my mom. \\nI was 16. Again, I was selling drugs, but I was also working at McDonald’s and going to school. \\nHe comes into church, sits behind us and goes like this to my mom. Taps on her shoulder, “Who’s that?” She almost cursed in church. “It’s a shame you don’t know your own son!” I turned around and almost flipped, but then I realized I was in church. I was like, “You made me and you don’t know who I am?!” \\nWhen she got pregnant by him, she was with him for, like, five years. She said, “I’m pregnant,” and the next day, he was gone. My father did this to five other women, the same exact thing, because I have five brothers. He did the same thing to each one of the women. \\nMy father, I almost killed him, in church. I was so angry. Yeaah. Yeaah. I was like, “How can you not know who I am? Where was you at?” Like, “Why don’t you want me? What did I do to you? I didn’t do anything to you. You made me,” but there was nothing, not a fuckin’ word, not a fuckin’ word. ORDER IT NOW \\nI never called him dad. I never called him pop. There was nothing until I turned 18. When we graduated high school, I paid for his parking to come see me graduate. That’s fucked up. \\nNow, my grandfather and grandma loved the shit out of me. I knew them. I knew them since I was three! \\nMy grandparents, they loved me. They knew who I was. My grandpop and grandmom used to always brag about me when I walked down the street, when I walked by the house, everything like that. They’d say, “There goes my grandson.” They would tell people,” There’s my grandson.” \\nMy father came to my graduation because I begged him to come. Face to face, I was like, “I’m your son. Aren’t you proud of me for graduating, at least?” He was like, “Well, she has money.” \\nI paid for his parking. I paid for his ticket. We got, like, three graduation tickets, and you had to pay for two more. I paid for it. I paid for him. It was $10 or something. He didn’t want to pay $10 to see his son graduate. \\nThat’s why I made a promise to myself. I said that when I have kids, no matter what happens between me and the girl, my kids are going to know who I am, and that I was there, so that’s what I’ve done. \\nTony gets mad that a lot of his crew don’t have cars and stuff, but when my son, my first born, made me a grandpa, I gave him my truck. \\nI know what it’s like to be on a bus with kids, grocery shopping and all that, with the kid wrapped around you, and you carrying bags and getting on a bus. I know what it’s like, so I gave him my truck. \\nI told Tony, “I ain’t got no vehicle, man. I gave it to my son. I ain’t got no car!” But it made me feel good, because I would never be like my father. Never! \\nWhen I hear people, because I hear people all the time, like how they hate their mom, how they hate their dad, and I’m like, I can see how you hate your dad, and you must have a reason, but at least you’re living together. I didn’t have that. All I had was my mom. You’ve got a mom and a dad, so you should be happy, you’re lucky, because I didn’t have that. \\nLinh Dinh is the author of two books of stories, five of poems, and a novel, Love Like Hate .

Mike Edmonson, he told reporters in November, “It is the most disturbing thing I’ve seen, and I will leave it at that.” \\nAccording to the lawsuit, referenced by KLFY , defendants include “Norris Greenhouse Jr. and Derrick Stafford, the two former Marksville Ward 2 deputy marshals facing second-degree murder and attempted second-degree murder in the case. Both pleaded not guilty and are facing separate trials. \\n“But the lawsuit also names as defendants Marksville City Marshal Floyd Voinche, the Marksville City Court, the town of Marksville, Avoyelles Parish, Progressive Paloverde Insurance Company and the other two officers involved in the chase of Few that night — Jason Brouillette and Kenneth Parnell III.” \\nOn November 3, 2015, according to the original police account, the four officers were attempting to serve a warrant for Few — who then fled in his sister’s Kia Sport, with Jeremy buckled in the passenger seat. \\nPolice had claimed Few was armed and posed an imminent deadly threat — so Officers Greenhouse and Stafford opened fire — emptying 18 rounds at the vehicle, critically injuring Few and killing the 6-year-old, who had autism. \\nIn actuality, no warrant had been issued for Few, and both father and son were unarmed — indeed, as video evidence shows, Few had his hands in the air when he received “two or three” bullets to the head and chest, while Jeremy suffered “four or five” shots to the head and neck. \\nAppallingly, Jeremy languished in agony, still holding onto life for over five minutes after being shot multiple times — but officers failed to even check for a pulse or render assistance. \\n“During this time, Jeremy was bleeding profusely and suffered immensely due to the gunshot wounds,” the lawsuit states, according to KFLY . \\n“It was not until approximately some seven and one-half to eight minutes or so after the hail of gunfire, that an officer at the scene, believed to be Parnell, finally checked Jeremy for a pulse and discovered that he was still alive, despite having been shot multiple times including in the head and neck,” it reads. \\n“However, none of the officers at the scene, including Stafford, Greenhouse, Brouillette and Parnell initiated or rendered any form of first aid, nor did they undertake any other measures in an attempt to stop Jeremy’s bleeding or otherwise alleviate or mitigate Jeremy’s suffering, or made any attempts to save his life. \\n“Sadly, Jeremy was left to suffer — and die — while the officers casually searched for ‘gloves.’” \\nAn exact motive for the original traffic stop — given the fictitious claim of a warrant and that Few did not have a weapon — has yet to be publicly released by officials. Attorneys for Greenhouse and Stafford stated during court proceedings Few had been standing in the road, blocking traffic, ignored officers’ commands, and then fled the scene. \\nBut the lawsuit contends there had been no clear reason for police to pursue the vehicle Few was driving, and when he ultimately did pull over, the vehicle, “even if it were moving forward or backwards — did not and could not have presented an imminent threat of death or great bodily harm to any of the officers at the scene or innocent bystanders.” \\nAs video clearly shows, Few pulled to the side of the road, raised his arms above his head and made no threatening gestures — in other words, he posed not even the slightest legitimate threat to their safety. The lawsuit continues : \\n“Moreover, at the time the pursuit of Christopher was initiated, and thereafter during the pursuit, none of the officers had reasonable or probable cause to believe that Christopher had committed some crime, was committing a crime or was about to commit a crime. The pursuit was unlawful, as was the subsequent use of deadly force.” \\nFatally shooting a 6-year-old child wasn’t the first brutal act by either Stafford or Greenhouse. As The Free Thought Project reported, the pair of rageful cops have a history of brutalizing their town with impunity — and as the lawsuit notes, it seems no vetting procedure was in place when Greenhouse and Stafford were hired. \\nAdditionally, when attorneys made a public records request with Marksville City Marshal Floyd Voinche for hiring, training, and disciplinary guidelines concerning deputy marshals, they received a telling one-sentence reply: “No such records exist.” \\n“The need for such policies is so obvious,” KFLY quotes the lawsuit, “for the safety of the public and the protection of constitutional rights that the lack of such policies constitutes deliberate indifference and a reckless disregard for the public and plaintiffs’ constitutional rights.” \\nBut the fact it took an innocent 6-year-old’s death to force the city to examine such policies is endemic of brutal policing in the United States — and one means officers can employ to work around appropriate discipline is to resign and simply move on to the next department. \\nIn late September, in a stunning act of hubris, Stafford again requested charges be dropped since he acted in self defense — despite damning evidence to the contrary. \\nThe family of Jeremy Mardis is requesting a jury trial in this lawsuit.

No doubt that has something to do with the fact that they realize their candidate is about to lose badly on Election Day. \\nThe perfect example of this was provided last night by Trump senior advisor AJ Delgado, who was appearing with GOP strategist Rick Wilson, who is supporting third-party candidate Evan McMullin. When host Chris Hayes mentioned Trump’s ties to white supremacists, Delgado got very agitated and said she was offended by the accusation. Hayes replied : “I just want to distinguish between two claims. If you’re a Trump supporter you’re there for a racist or white supremacist which I would never say and don’t think Rick would say. The people out there that are racist and white supremacist, they’re overwhelmingly and publicly supporting Donald Trump.” \\nDelgado yelled: “That’s not true!” \\nWilson then joined the conversation, telling Delgado: “AJ, it is true. The people on the white supremacists alt-right movement in this country flock to Donald Trump.” \\nLater in the debate, Delgado claimed that the average voter doesn’t care about Trump’s support from white supremacists such as David Duke, former Grand Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan (KKK). Wilson let Delgado have it for that comment: “This is a guy who is feeding these people with a nod and a wink every single day. A guy who constantly denigrates women, Muslims, minorities in a host of different ways. I’m not saying every person who supports Donald Trump is a racist, that’s absurd. Every racist you turn over — every time you turn over a rock and find a racist, they have a red MAGA hat on. There is not a — there’s not a coincidence here.” \\nExactly! Trump has been playing footsie with neo-Nazis, the KKK, and other white supremacist/white nationalist groups since he started his campaign. For him or anyone who supports him to now appear offended when someone makes that connection is not only disingenuous, it’s downright ludicrous. As the old saying goes, If you lie down with dogs, you wake up with fleas. \\nFeatured Image Via YouTube Screengrab About Andrew Bradford \\nAndrew Bradford is a single father who lives in Atlanta.

[“The Department of Homeland Security will continue to enforce all of President Trump’s Executive Orders in a manner that ensures the safety and security of the American people,” the agency made in a statement sent to reporters on Sunday.  They reminded Americans that only a small percentage of travelers were affected by the new restrictions.  The agency noted that although some individuals were held for further screening, some of them were allowed entry into the United States, despite protesters at area airports describing the order as a “Muslim ban. ” “These individuals went through enhanced security screenings and are being processed for entry to the United States, consistent with our immigration laws and judicial orders,” the department said. The agency did not signal that they were prepared to back down from the rigorous enforcement of Trump’s executive action. “The Department of Homeland Security will comply with judicial orders faithfully enforce our immigration laws, and implement President Trump’s Executive Orders to ensure that those entering the United States do not pose a threat to our country or the American people,” the statement concluded.

              "13863  How Small Forests Can Help Save the Planet - The New York Times                              Erica Goode                        BIRKENFELD, Ore.  —   Eve Lonnquist’s family has owned a forest in the mountains of northwest Oregon since her grandmother bought the land in 1919. Her    father still lives on the   property. And she and her wife often drive up from their home just outside Portland. But lately, Ms. Lonnquist, 59 and recently retired, has been thinking about the future of her family’s land. Like many   owners, they draw some income from logging and would like to keep doing so. But they would also like to see the forest, with its stands of Douglas fir, alder and cherry, protected from   or being sold off to developers. “For us, the property is our family’s history,” she said. More than half of the 751 million acres of forestland in the United States are privately owned, most by people like Ms. Lonnquist, with holdings of 1, 000 acres or less. These family forests, environmental groups argue, represent a large, untapped resource for combating the effects of climate change. Conserving the trees and profiting from them might seem incompatible. But Ms. Lonnquist is hoping to do both by capitalizing on the forest’s ability to clean the air, turning the carbon stored in the forest into credits that can then be sold to polluters who want or need to offset their carbon footprints. “Trees are the No. 1 way in which carbon can be removed from the atmosphere and stored in vegetation over the long term,” said Brian Kittler, the western regional office director for the Pinchot Institute for Conservation, which has a program in Oregon to help the owners of family forests develop potentially profitable carbon projects. Larger forests around the world have already been enlisted as carbon storehouses, through programs like the United Nations initiative for Reducing Emissions From Deforestation and Forest Degradation, or REDD, that encourage forest conservation worldwide in exchange for credits that can be sold on the global carbon markets. Some large timber companies, including Potlatch, have also entered the markets, reducing their logging to levels below legal limits in order to receive millions of dollars in credits. But so far,   owners, even   ones like Ms. Lonnquist, have not rushed to embrace   carbon storage. Many do not even know it exists, and those who do often find the complexities bewildering. Some owners believe, wrongly, that to enter the carbon markets they must forgo all income from logging. And some, reluctant to forfeit the ability to quickly turn their trees into cash, have balked at signing a contract to keep a forest standing for 15 to 125 years. Even more daunting, the expense of bringing a forest to the carbon market  —   a process that involves taking an inventory of the trees, assessing the forest’s carbon content, estimating future growth, and submitting to several levels of auditing  —   has been so high that it would eliminate any profit for most small landholders. Environmental organizations like the Pinchot Institute and the Nature Conservancy have for years been searching for a way around these hurdles by educating landowners about the markets’ potential for generating income and finding ways to decrease the costs. “Traditionally, your only tool to generate revenues has been periodic timber harvest,” said Josh Parrish, director of the Nature Conservancy’s Working Woodlands program, which is working with the owners of private forests in Pennsylvania and Tennessee. “The nice thing about carbon is essentially people are being paid to improve forest management. ” In fact, if   owners can get past the barriers, the carbon markets can be profitable, providing an initial flush of money and then regular yearly payments in much smaller amounts. The carbon credits from Ms. Lonnquist’s forest could bring an estimated $235, 000 over the first six years, and about $6, 000 a year after that, said Kyle Holland, the managing director of Ecological Carbon Offset Partners, a California firm that helps   owners enter the carbon markets. Ms. Lonnquist and her family could still log on a limited basis, as long as they stuck to a plan for managing the forest and maintained a steady level of carbon storage through the forest’s continued growth. The economic case for private owners entering the carbon markets is likely to get stronger. Forests, especially in areas like the Northwest, where trees grow tall and thick, tend to draw higher prices than many other conservation measures. And with last year’s Paris climate pact, some analysts expect carbon prices, now about $3 to $12 per ton in the United States, to rise. Mr. Kittler said the conservation institute, which is subsidizing the preparation of Ms. Lonnquist’s forest with the help of a grant from the Department of Agriculture and has partnered with Mr. Holland’s firm for the Oregon project, hoped it would encourage more private owners to enter the markets. Ms. Lonnquist and other owners will be given a choice of selling credits on the global market or on California’s market, created under the state’s 2006 Global Warming Solutions Act. Recent developments in forestry may help make the prospect more appealing by lowering the initial costs to landholders. Mr. Holland’s company, for example, has developed a digital tool  —   a smartphone equipped with a laser to measure distance and an inclinometer to measure height  —   that he believes will greatly reduce the expense of conducting a forest inventory, which typically costs $40, 000 to $100, 000 or more, depending about the amount of land. With the specialized smartphone, landholders can take an inventory themselves, photographing and measuring the diameters and heights of their trees. The photos and data are sent to the company’s office in California, where an expert forester goes through the images, identifying the species and checking for damage to the branches or crowns, among other things. Probability models are used to calculate the amount of carbon stored in the forest. The mathematical proofs developed by the company have been submitted to a scientific journal, Mr. Holland said. Using traditional methods, a forester conducting an inventory averages three or four forest plots per day and can spend months completing an assessment at a cost of $350 a plot, he said. But Logan Sander, a forester who used the smartphone to inventory Ms. Lonnquist’s forest and recently demonstrated it for two visitors, said he was averaging 30 to 35 plots a day, with the entire job taking only a week to complete. Individual forest owners who sign up for Mr. Holland’s service pay a $75 application fee and receive the smartphone. If, after conducting an inventory, they choose to move forward with the carbon project, they pay the company $1, 350 to complete the process. Some small properties do not store enough carbon to make even that effort worthwhile. The price of carbon, Mr. Holland said, has to be $10 or more per ton “to make it pencil out” for the owner. And novel methods like Mr. Holland’s still need approval from the companies that verify forest inventories or serve as official market registries. But Jessica Orrego, the director of forestry for the American Carbon Registry, said such advances might be the key to bringing in   owners. “We’re fully supportive,” she said. “We’re advocates of innovation. We think it’s extremely important in the carbon market. ” Ms. Lonnquist, who owns the forest here with two brothers and her wife, Lynn Baker, is still considering whether entering the carbon markets would make sense for her family. The commitment  —   125 years if the credits are sold in the California market  —   gives her some pause, she said. “That’s well beyond our lifetime, and that’s a commitment that goes with the property,” she said. She can imagine, though, what she might be doing 20 years from now. “Maybe I’d just be at home growing carbon,” she said. “And maybe that’s the best thing. ”

              "13862  Tillerson, Trump, ‘Beauty and the Beast’: Your Friday Evening Briefing - The New York Times  Karen Zraick and Lisa Iaboni       (Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the  .) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. President Trump stood by his wiretapping claim at a news conference with Angela Merkel. The background: On Thursday, his top spokesman, Sean Spicer, had repeated an unverified claim that Britain’s spy agency monitored Mr. Trump during the campaign at the behest of President Barack Obama. The British were furious, but Mr. Trump made clear that he saw no reason to apologize. During the Obama years, Ms. Merkel, the German leader, had been angered by reports that the U. S. had tapped her phone. Turning to her at the White House on Friday, Mr. Trump said, “At least we have something in common, perhaps. ” _____ 2. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said for the first time that the Trump administration might take   action if North Korea’s nuclear threat reached an unacceptable level. During a visit to South Korea, Mr. Tillerson ruled out negotiations with the North over its nuclear and missile programs. Whether he takes a hard line with China  —   where he is headed next  —   over its support for North Korea will be closely watched, as will be the response of China. _____ 3. More grim developments in Syria and Yemen: In Syria, the country’s armed forces fired missiles at Israeli warplanes near Palmyra, in what appeared to be the most serious clash between the two militaries in years. The U. S. military denied reports that it had bombed a Syrian mosque, but confirmed that a nearby building was struck. A human rights group said 42 people were killed. Above, the volunteer rescue group the White Helmets dug through the rubble. Off the coast of Yemen, more than 30 Somali migrants were killed when a military helicopter opened fire on their boat. Yemeni officials blamed a   military coalition for the attack. _____ 4. As a Marine sergeant, James LaPorta once led an intelligence team in Afghanistan. Now, as a private citizen, he is tracking the moves of a Facebook group that has been secretly compiling and sharing nude photos of hundreds of women in the Marine Corps. “The Marine Corps can’t do this alone. The internet is too huge,” Mr. LaPorta said. “We need to police ourselves. ” _____ 5. The Nobel laureate Derek Walcott died at 87. His poetry captured the beauty of the Caribbean and the harsh legacy of colonialism. Here are some lines from his work: _____ 6. A new heart drug could be a   but it comes with a high price: $14, 523 a year. Those who took the drug Repatha were significantly less likely to have heart attacks or strokes, researchers found in a new study. The drug, manufactured by Amgen, has the potential to help millions of Americans with heart disease, which is the nation’s leading killer. Robert Johnson, above with his daughters, says he feels “much safer” taking the drug. His father died of a heart attack at 42. _____ 7. Our personal finance writer delves into our nation’s maddeningly complex system of financial aid for higher education. His conclusion: “If you have a child who is already walking and talking and you will not be able to write a check to pay tuition, it’s best to start studying up on it now or finding a political candidate to support who will blow it all up. ” _____ 8. We explored the beautiful, eerie world beneath the ice in northern Quebec to hunt for fresh mussels. In the coldest months of the year, when the ice is thickest and unusually large tides empty the bay under it, some Inuit people venture into the luminous ice caves. The mussels, a welcome winter treat these days, were at one time a lifesaving source of food. _____ 9. Happy St. Patrick’s Day. We assembled a collection of recipes you might want to explore this weekend, including traditional fare like corned beef, Guinness pie and soda bread. And then there are some green dishes that don’t require food coloring, like the Green Goddess dressing of herbs, garlic and anchovies above. _____ 10. Finally, what to watch this weekend? Here are some ideas: the movies that influenced “Get Out” new original content on Amazon and the N. C. A. A. tournament. “Beauty and the Beast” also opens in theaters. Jimmy Kimmel used his   for the new movie to take another swipe at the president. Have a great weekend. _____ Photographs may appear out of order for some readers.

              "13861  Donald Trump Lashes Out at Media While Detailing Gifts to Veterans - The New York Times      Maggie Haberman and Ashley Parker  He called a news conference ostensibly to answer questions about his   for charities that benefit military veterans. But Donald J. Trump instead spent most of his time on live television Tuesday berating the journalists covering his presidential campaign in unusually vitriolic and personal terms. “You’re a sleaze,” he told a reporter for ABC. “You’re a real beauty,” he told a reporter for CNN, snidely denigrating the man’s competence. For 40 minutes, Mr. Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, assailed those reporting on his candidacy with a level of venom rarely seen at all, let alone in public, from the   of a major political party. Then he warned that a Trump White House would feature more of the same. Historians reached back to the Nixon administration, with its   enemies list, for a fair comparison. Other scholars and political analysts suggested that Mr. Trump failed to appreciate the role journalists play in scrutinizing candidates as surrogates for the public, or drew connections to his denunciations of other adversaries and critics  —   like a federal judge in a case where Mr. Trump is being sued, or the Republican governor of New Mexico, whom Mr. Trump denigrated while campaigning in her state last week. Mr. Trump’s broadside was especially provocative given that concerns have been raised throughout the campaign about whether the news media collectively have failed to subject his candidacy to enough scrutiny and skepticism. The particular knot in which Mr. Trump entangled himself on Tuesday had come to light through simple  . In January, fuming at Fox News, he skipped the final Republican debate before the Iowa caucuses because that network was hosting it. He held his own competing event, a televised   that he said would benefit military veterans, and announced from the stage that he had raised more than $6 million, including $1 million he was donating himself. But the full amount did not materialize quickly, and The Washington Post reported a week ago that Mr. Trump had yet to make his own donation. In his news conference, Mr. Trump produced and read aloud a list of charitable groups and the exact amounts he said each had received, interrupting himself frequently to condemn individual journalists, the news media in general, or political reporters as an exceptionally odious class. “Unbelievably dishonest,” he called them. To show that he had finally made his own   donation, Mr. Trump produced a photocopy of a check. (His litany of recipients glossed over an admission that his January boast had indeed been an exaggeration: All told, he said, $5. 6 million has been provided to or earmarked for charities so far.) “The press should be ashamed of themselves,” Mr. Trump said. Veterans are “calling me, and they are furious,” he said, adding, “You make me look very bad. ” Kathleen Hall Jamieson, an expert on the presidency and director of the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania, said Mr. Trump appeared to be making assumptions about journalism that were “so faulty as to be bizarre. ” “The notion that the press would be writing stories praising him for keeping a promise he made in public to veterans, months after he made the promise, suggests he simply does not understand the function of the press,” she said. And the president of the National Press Club, Thomas Burr, issued a blistering statement suggesting that Mr. Trump “misunderstands  —   or, more likely, simply opposes  —   the role a free press plays in a democratic society. ” “Any American political candidate who attacks the press for doing its job is campaigning in the wrong country,” Mr. Burr said. Mr. Trump has routinely treated journalists as foils, and those covering his campaign appearances as unwitting, unspeaking extras good for a joke or two. On Tuesday, however, reporters played a sharply different role, repeatedly pressing him for answers. Why had he waited so long to make his own donation? Several times, Mr. Trump said that it had taken time to scrutinize charities to make sure they were legitimate, though the recipient of his $1 million check was a group well known to him: Its vice chairman is the managing director of the Trump SoHo hotel, and the group gave Mr. Trump an award last year. Strangely, Mr. Trump also suggested that the delays somehow owed to a desire to keep a low profile. “I didn’t want the credit for it,” he said, adding moments later, “I’m not looking for credit. ” Yet Mr. Trump had announced his   for veterans on national television in January and had trumpeted it several times since, a reporter countered. Wasn’t that taking credit? “I don’t think so,” Mr. Trump replied tersely, quickly taking another question. In the past, Mr. Trump has used evasive maneuvers to sidestep difficult questions and made    statements that often went unchallenged at the time. But even after a query about the shooting of a gorilla at an Ohio zoo over the weekend, reporters brought Mr. Trump back to the matter at hand. If he had intended to deliver a cogent attack on his likely Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, or to promote his plans for how to improve veterans’ assistance as president, his performance squashed it. The   group Correct the Record responded by saying the performance raised new questions about Mr. Trump’s temperament. “Under pressure for lying about his monetary support for our veterans, Trump threw a tantrum  —   hurling insults at reporters instead of owning up to his broken promise to veterans,” the group said in a statement. “Trump’s failure to face even the tiniest amount of media scrutiny about his supposed support for America’s veterans exposes just how unqualified he is to be our country’s commander in chief. ” But Mr. Trump, in the moment at least, seemed unconcerned. A reporter asked if Mr. Trump’s demeanor was an indication of what White House news conferences would be like if he were elected. “Yes, it is,” he said. “It is going to be like this. ”

              "13860  Donald Trump Jr. Criticizes London Mayor After Deadly Attack - The New York Times            Liam Stack                         It has become something of an online custom in the social media age to react to tragic news stories  —   like Wednesday’s attack in London  —   with   if sometimes rote messages like “thoughts and prayers. ” But that does not appear to be Donald Trump Jr. ’s style. “You have to be kidding me? !” Mr. Trump said Wednesday afternoon on Twitter, as details of the episode  —   which left at least five dead, including the assailant, and 40 injured  —   continued to unfold. The message continued, “Terror attacks are part of living in big city, says London Mayor Sadiq Khan. ” Mr. Trump, the oldest son of President Trump, was calling attention to an article from September in The Independent, a British newspaper, that described Mr. Khan’s reaction to a bombing then in the Chelsea neighborhood of New York City. Mr. Trump mischaracterized the London mayor’s remarks. Mr. Khan did not describe terrorism as “part of living in a big city,” as if bombings and shootings were an inescapable fact of life. He said that terrorism preparedness, including providing sufficient support to the police, was “part and parcel of living in a great global city. ” “That means being vigilant, having a police force that is in touch with communities it means the security services being ready, but it also means exchanging ideas and best practice,” Mr. Khan said in a video interview published by The Evening Standard, another British paper. (For the record, Mr. Khan did say the victims of the Chelsea bombing were in his “thoughts and prayers. ”) “Nothing is more important to me than keeping Londoners safe,” Mr. Khan added. “I want to be reassured that every single agency and individual involved in protecting our city has the resources and expertise they need to respond in the event that London is attacked. ” On Thursday morning, Mr. Khan said in an interview on CNN that he would not respond to Mr. Trump’s tweet because he had “been doing far more important things over the last 24 hours. ” “What I do know is that the threat level in London and across the country is severe,” he said. “That means an attack is highly likely. I was in New York last year when there was an attack in New York. And terrorists hate the fact that whether it’s New York, whether it’s London, whether it’s Paris, whether its Brussels, whether it’s Istanbul, whether it’s Madrid, we have diverse communities living together peacefully. ” Mr. Trump’s tweet was not well received by Britons, who were still learning details of the attack when he weighed in. On Twitter, Wes Streeting, a member of Parliament from the Labour Party, accused Mr. Trump of capitalizing on the attack in London and called him “a disgrace. ” Ciaran Jenkins, a correspondent for Britain’s Channel 4, asked the president’s son on Twitter if he thought his remarks were “helpful. ” “Did you even read the article before goading London’s Mayor during a live incident?” he wrote. He added, “Headline is based on very first sentence, which if you’d bothered to read it could apply to any major city in the world. Key word: ‘threat.’ ” Mr. Trump declined to elaborate later on Wednesday. “I’m not going to comment on every tweet I send,” he said in an email. Political violence in the United Kingdom is relatively rare. Decades of sectarian violence in Northern Ireland often spilled over, but there had not been a   attack in Britain since 2005, when  more than 50 people died in subway and bus attacks.

              "0      House Dem Aide: We Didn’t Even See Comey’s Letter Until Jason Chaffetz Tweeted It            Darrell Lucus                      House Dem Aide: We Didn’t Even See Comey’s Letter Until Jason Chaffetz Tweeted It By Darrell Lucus on October 30, 2016 Subscribe Jason Chaffetz on the stump in American Fork, Utah ( image courtesy Michael Jolley, available under a Creative Commons-BY license) \\nWith apologies to Keith Olbermann, there is no doubt who the Worst Person in The World is this week–FBI Director James Comey. But according to a House Democratic aide, it looks like we also know who the second-worst person is as well. It turns out that when Comey sent his now-infamous letter announcing that the FBI was looking into emails that may be related to Hillary Clinton’s email server, the ranking Democrats on the relevant committees didn’t hear about it from Comey. They found out via a tweet from one of the Republican committee chairmen. \\nAs we now know, Comey notified the Republican chairmen and Democratic ranking members of the House Intelligence, Judiciary, and Oversight committees that his agency was reviewing emails it had recently discovered in order to see if they contained classified information. Not long after this letter went out, Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz set the political world ablaze with this tweet. FBI Dir just informed me, \"The FBI has learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation.\" Case reopened \\n— Jason Chaffetz (@jasoninthehouse) October 28, 2016 \\nOf course, we now know that this was not the case . Comey was actually saying that it was reviewing the emails in light of “an unrelated case”–which we now know to be Anthony Weiner’s sexting with a teenager. But apparently such little things as facts didn’t matter to Chaffetz. The Utah Republican had already vowed to initiate a raft of investigations if Hillary wins–at least two years’ worth, and possibly an entire term’s worth of them. Apparently Chaffetz thought the FBI was already doing his work for him–resulting in a tweet that briefly roiled the nation before cooler heads realized it was a dud. \\nBut according to a senior House Democratic aide, misreading that letter may have been the least of Chaffetz’ sins. That aide told Shareblue that his boss and other Democrats didn’t even know about Comey’s letter at the time–and only found out when they checked Twitter. “Democratic Ranking Members on the relevant committees didn’t receive Comey’s letter until after the Republican Chairmen. In fact, the Democratic Ranking Members didn’ receive it until after the Chairman of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee, Jason Chaffetz, tweeted it out and made it public.” \\nSo let’s see if we’ve got this right. The FBI director tells Chaffetz and other GOP committee chairmen about a major development in a potentially politically explosive investigation, and neither Chaffetz nor his other colleagues had the courtesy to let their Democratic counterparts know about it. Instead, according to this aide, he made them find out about it on Twitter. \\nThere has already been talk on Daily Kos that Comey himself provided advance notice of this letter to Chaffetz and other Republicans, giving them time to turn on the spin machine. That may make for good theater, but there is nothing so far that even suggests this is the case. After all, there is nothing so far that suggests that Comey was anything other than grossly incompetent and tone-deaf. \\nWhat it does suggest, however, is that Chaffetz is acting in a way that makes Dan Burton and Darrell Issa look like models of responsibility and bipartisanship. He didn’t even have the decency to notify ranking member Elijah Cummings about something this explosive. If that doesn’t trample on basic standards of fairness, I don’t know what does. \\nGranted, it’s not likely that Chaffetz will have to answer for this. He sits in a ridiculously Republican district anchored in Provo and Orem; it has a Cook Partisan Voting Index of R+25, and gave Mitt Romney a punishing 78 percent of the vote in 2012. Moreover, the Republican House leadership has given its full support to Chaffetz’ planned fishing expedition. But that doesn’t mean we can’t turn the hot lights on him. After all, he is a textbook example of what the House has become under Republican control. And he is also the Second Worst Person in the World. About Darrell Lucus \\nDarrell is a 30-something graduate of the University of North Carolina who considers himself a journalist of the old school. An attempt to turn him into a member of the religious right in college only succeeded in turning him into the religious right's worst nightmare--a charismatic Christian who is an unapologetic liberal. His desire to stand up for those who have been scared into silence only increased when he survived an abusive three-year marriage. You may know him on Daily Kos as Christian Dem in NC .
